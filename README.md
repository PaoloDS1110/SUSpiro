The purpose of this project is to create a PDF file readily available, for teachers nad students of guitar (jazz). The PDF alone is not sufficient for the sself-taught student, as it contains virtually no verbose explanation of the material. The intended use is that of the teacher using each page as the basis for detailed instructions.
